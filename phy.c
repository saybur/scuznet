/*
 * Here are some notes on how resetting, selection, arbitration, and
 * reselection are implemented in this file. These steps are sensitive to bus
 * timing, and thus mostly occur in the interrupt context. The actual code
 * is probably a little hard to follow, so hopefully this explains things more
 * clearly.
 * 
 * Responding to /RST uses the "hard reset" option. There is a timer set to
 * increment in response to the event system, which is tied into the /RST line
 * with a digital filter to ignore very short pulses. When that timer ticks up
 * due to the event system detecting a solid assertion of /RST, the software
 * reset mechanism is invoked: this is mainly done to make sure that the bus
 * lines are tri-stated as quickly as possible. Upon restart, phy_init_hold()
 * prevents device startup from proceeding until /RST is no longer asserted.
 * 
 * Selection involves detecting the de-assertion edge of /BSY while /SEL is
 * still asserted. This only occurs during a (RE)SELECTION on the bus. The ISR
 * checks the state of things, and if everything indicates selection on the
 * owned mask bits, the ISR responds to selection and sets the activity flag.
 * 
 * Reselection requires arbitration, which can be tricky, since the timing of
 * things is quite tight. Bus arbitration proceeds through the following steps
 * in the general case, with clock notations measured in device clocks @ 32MHz:
 * 
 * 1) A device releases all signals and the bus enters the BUS FREE phase.
 * 2) After at least 800ns (~26 cycles) a device may assert /BSY and start to
 *    arbitrate. Devices cannot enter arbitration if it has been more than
 *    1000ns since they last detected BUS FREE.
 * 3) 2400ns (~76 cycles) after asserting /BSY, a device may check the bus
 *    and see if they won. The winning device may assert /SEL. Losing devices
 *    are suggested to keep /BSY set and the ID bits on the bus until /SEL goes
 *    true, then release all signals within 800ns (~26 cycles).
 * 4) The winner must wait at least 1200ns (~38 cycles) after asserting /SEL
 *    before changing any other signals. At this point, ARBITRATION is done,
 *    and the winner may proceed with SELECTION by asserting its ID, the target
 *    ID, optionally asserting I/O to make the phase RESELECTION, and by
 *    releasing /BSY.
 * 
 * We handle the above as follows:
 * 
 * Upon a request for reselection, we start a timer dedicated to monitoring
 * the period from the last /BSY rise, set to wrap every ~500us or so if we
 * don't detect a /BSY rise during that time (common either during bus idle or
 * long transactions). This timer uses the event system to reset automatically
 * on /BSY rise to avoid delays from the CPU being busy. The CCA of that timer
 * is set to fire at a reasonable delay after /BSY goes up. If conditions are
 * right, that ISR starts the arbitration process and sets up both a CCB ISR
 * for the same timer *and* a /SEL ISR for the assertion edge of that signal.
 * 
 * If the /SEL ISR fires, it is an indication that another device won
 * arbitration. We immediately release all signals and reset things to let the
 * CCA timer fire again later to try arbitrating again.
 * 
 * If not stopped by the /SEL ISR, the CCB timer fires about 2400ns later. It
 * checks things, and if we are the arbitration winner, it asserts /SEL and
 * starts the reselection process on the initiator, then releases /BSY.  A
 * secondary timer is used to check at a frequent interval to see when /BSY 
 * becomes set.
 * 
 * When that secondary timer sees /BSY set, it performs a similar set of steps
 * to the normal selection response routine in the main /BSY ISR, and sets
 * the status flags. At this point, the logic flow works basically the same
 * as for a normal selection, and life moves on.

	 *    the direct lookup address into SRAM to get the parity data,
	 * 3) Force usage of the Y pointer for the data output operation, and
	 * 4) Give manual control over the degree of loop unrolling.
	 * 
	 * This is dependent on a few things being set elsewhere:
	 * 
	 * 1) The card USART must be operating at full speed, 16 CPU cycles/byte.
	 * 2) The bits-set array must be aligned to a 256 byte boundary.
	 * 
	 * This feels more than a little hacky, so if anyone has any insight on
	 * ways to force GCC to do these things in C I'm all ears.
