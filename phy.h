#ifndef PHY_H

/*
 * Defines the low-level interface used by this device for communicating as a
 * target on a mostly compliant early generation parallel SCSI bus.
 * 
 * This part of the implementation is concerned with the physical layer, along
 * with certain timing-sensitive components of the logical layer that are
 * involved with arbitration and selection modes of the bus.
 */

/*
 * ============================================================================
 *  
 *   USAGE INFORMATION
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * During initialization, call phy_init() with the mask of the target(s) that
 * will be managed by this device. After that, call phy_init_hold() to keep 
 * further startup actions from proceeding until a possible reset condition
 * ends. Upon return of this call, the PHY is active.
 * 
 * After phy_init_hold() ends interrupts will be enabled, with the /RST ISR
 * at high priority and the /BSY ISR at medium priority. Whenever the target
 * mask given during startup is matched this code will automatically respond
 * to selection and change the PHY_STATUS_REGISTER to indicate that the device
 * mode has changed. The main loop should check phy_is_active() frequently
 * and react accordingly when set.
 * 
 * Once in the driver seat, main code can change phases via phy_phase() to
 * proceed through the different bus phases. Refer to that function for details
 * on how phase transistions work.
 * 
 * The main ways to send and receive data in normal operations is via the
 * various _offer() and _ask() functions, which handle the /REQ and /ACK
 * interlock used during normal transfers. There are both single-byte and
 * multiple-byte versions for different uses, with the multiple-byte versions
 * generally offering better performance.
 * 
 * Once done with the bus, call phy_phase() with PHY_PHASE_BUS_FREE, which will
 * release the bus for other uses.
 * 
 * Finally, some devices may wish to actively reselect the initiator. To do
 * this, call phy_reselect(). To check for when reselection has been achieved,
 * in the main loop, check both phy_is_active() and phy_is_continued() are
 * set. For implementation details, refer to documentation in the phy.c code.

 * The condition flags and macros used with PHY_REGISTER_STATUS. The macro
 * approach is preferred for external code.
 * 
 * PHY_STATUS_ACTIVE_bm: when set, the device is in active control of the bus
 * as a target.
 * 
 * PHY_STATUS_CONTINUED_bm: only set when PHY_STATUS_ACTIVE_bm is set. If set,
 * this indicates that the device is active as a result of a reselection, to
 * continue a previous action.
 * 
 * PHY_STATUS_ASK_RESELECT_bm: a device has asked for reselection, which will
 * be attempted at the next opportunity.
 * 
 * PHY_STATUS_RESELECT_PARITY_bm: if set, the parity bit needs to be set when
 * the reselection routine is trying to reselect the initiator. This is not
 * used when parity is disabled.

 * asserted.
 * 
 * Operations that drive the data lines will leave them asserted after
 * returning. This is normally OK, and will be reset during a phase change.
 * 
 * "Offers" in this context are transfers from the target to the initiator
 * (DATA IN and others) and "asks" are transfers from the initiator to the
 * target (DATA OUT and others).
 * 
 * TODO: each of these functions is vulnerable to busy-wait locks when the
 * initiator fails to respond to a /REQ assertion, which should be corrected
 * in a future version of the software.
