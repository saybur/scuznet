/*
 * Abstraction layer over memory card operations.
 * 
 * Users must first initialize the device by using mem_init() and
 * mem_init_card(), following the instructions in those functions. Users may
 * then execute operations via the following sequence:
 * 
 * 1) mem_op_start(), checking the response to see if the card is busy.
 * 2) mem_op_cmd() to send a command, checking the command response.
 * 3) Perform any command-specific data transfers.
 * 4) mem_op_end() to stop.
 *
 * Here's a simple example, reading a single block (CMD17) from address 0 and
 * writing each byte of the response (including CRC) to a debug() function:
 * 
 * if (mem_op_start())
 * {
 *   uint8_t arg[4] = { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };
 *   uint8_t r = mem_op_cmd_args(17, arg);
 *   if (r == 0x00)
 *   {
 *     r = mem_wait_for_data();
 *     if (r == 0xFE)
 *     {
 *       for (uint16_t i = 0; i < 514; i++)
 *       {
 *         MEM_USART.DATA = 0xFF;
 *         while (mem_data_not_ready());
 *         debug(MEM_USART.DATA);
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *   mem_op_end();
 * }
 * 
 * Note the above doesn't do much error checking, beyond verifying that the
 * response codes are sensible.
 * 
 * There are also a limited number of higher-level operations available. Refer
 * to those functions for more details.

/*
 * Status codes returned by mem_init_card(). Most are not terribly important,

 * Note that all values between 128 and 254 are reserved for various failures
 * that will prevent the system from coming online correctly, so that range
 * can be checked for specifically.
